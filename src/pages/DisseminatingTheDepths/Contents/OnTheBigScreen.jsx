        SOI&rsquo;s commitment to scientific exploration and marine discovery
        extends beyond traditional research avenues, as we recognize the power
        of visual storytelling in conveying the profound beauty and mysteries
        hidden beneath the Ocean's surface. As such, participation in film
        festivals serves multiple goals: sharing our advances in cutting-edge
        technology and scientific findings while engaging a broader audience
        through mesmerizing footage from our underwater robot, ROV{" "}

        Six short films created either by or in partnership with SOI, using
        footage from ROV <em>SuBastain</em> and activities on Research Vessels
        <em>Falkor</em> and<em> Falkor (too),</em> were accepted into five film
        festivals this year, winning nine awards of recognition. A partnership
        with Natural World Facts, or NWF, a popular YouTube channel with over
