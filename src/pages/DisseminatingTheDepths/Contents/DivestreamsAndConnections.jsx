        <strong>Disseminating the Depths: Divestreams and Connections</strong>
      </h3>
      <p>
        During <em>Falkor (too)&rsquo;s </em>inaugural year<em>, </em>SOI made
        significant improvements to two popular ship-based outreach initiatives:
        the ROV Divestream and the Ship-to-Shore program. We added a new crew
        position &mdash; a multimedia technician &mdash; and rebranded the ROV
        Livestream as{" "}
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@SchmidtOcean/streams">
          the SOI Divestream
        </a>
        . Working alongside Data Architect Corinne Bassin, the multimedia
        technician, or MT, reconfigured data overlays into a sleek and
        accessible design. The ship&rsquo;s mission control room was outfitted
        with new equipment throughout the year to enhance the Divestream
        experience for the viewing audience so they can virtually join the
        science team as they explore deep ocean environments.
      </p>
      <p>
        Scientists are encouraged to narrate the Divestream in the language they
        feel most comfortable speaking, resulting in numerous hours of Spanish
        narration and interaction with Spanish-speaking viewers. Some scientists
        moderated the dive in German and Dutch as well. Throughout the year,
        more than 300,000 people viewed the Divestream, experiencing science,
        engineering, and discovery in real time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Additionally, SOI adapted the Ship-to-Shore program from<em> Falkor</em>{" "}
        to{" "}
        <em>Falkor (too) </em>with a more efficient{" "}
        <a href="https://schmidtocean.org/ship-to-shore-program/">
          sign-up process
        </a>{" "}
        and a new virtual assembly format. For 2023 and beyond, ship-to-shore
        encounters will happen primarily with community groups living in the
        country where the ship is operating. Regular{" "}

        will provide ship-to-shore experiences to a broader audience.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sixty-two connections occurred during the year, reaching 8,600 people
        from Ecuador, Costa Rica, Puerto Rico, Venezuela, the United States,
        Japan, Spain, Italy, Canada, the Netherlands, and Austria. Twenty-eight
        connections in Spanish reached people living in Latin American
        countries, and a collaboration with the Charles Darwin Foundation
        resulted in eleven connections reaching over 350 children living on the
        Gal&aacute;pagos islands.

        A year of discoveries led to a plethora of media coverage. SOI published
        13 press releases in 2023, citing 13 findings and resulting in more than
        4,000 new stories. Of note was co-founder and president Wendy
        Schmidt&rsquo;s interview on{" "}

      <p>
        Footage collected by SOI&rsquo;s ROV <em>SuBastian</em> was licensed 24
        times appearing in an BBC Planet Earth III episode, X, and X. Our new
        Creative Commons licensing allowed X people to download footage with
        ease.
      </p>
      <p>
        A new collaboration with NASDAQ and the Charles Darwin Foundation led to
        a 10-minute video of footage from our Galapagos expeditions playing on
        the final day of New York Climate Week in Times Square.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, SOI entered into a partnership with BBC for footage sharing and
        filming on SOI expeditions where the footage will contribute to a global
        and prominent series scheduled for 2025.

        SOI&rsquo;s commitment to scientific exploration and marine discovery
        extends beyond traditional research avenues, as we recognize the power
        of visual storytelling in conveying the profound beauty and mysteries
        hidden beneath the Ocean's surface. As such, participation in film
        festivals serves multiple goals: sharing our advances in cutting-edge
        technology and scientific findings while engaging a broader audience
        through mesmerizing footage from our underwater robot, ROV{" "}
        <em>SuBastian</em>.

        ROV <em>SuBastain</em> was the primary source of underwater footage in{" "}

        Jason Momoa that premiered at the prestigious Sundance Film Festival.
        The film garnered global press coverage including CNN, The Guardian,
        Entertainment Weekly, and the New York Times. <em>Deep Rising</em> ran
        in over 50 festivals worldwide and used SOI still imagery in editorial
        articles and promotionally.

        Six short films created either by or in partnership with SOI, using
        footage from ROV <em>SuBastain</em> and activities on Research Vessels
        <em>Falkor</em> and<em> Falkor (too),</em> were accepted into five film
        festivals this year, winning nine awards of recognition. A partnership
        with Natural World Facts, or NWF, a popular YouTube channel with over
        808,000 subscribers, resulted in a new 30-minute film called &ldquo;
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTKUEvGYvSg">
          Mysteries of the Twilight Zone
        </a>

          Robots in the Deep,

        film&rsquo;s First Director, Leo Richards, was invited to the
        International Ocean Film Festival in San Francisco, where he served on
        panels and discussed working with SOI on the projects.
