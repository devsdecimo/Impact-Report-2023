        <h3>Pink Flamingo Society</h3>
        <p>
          In November, the Pink Flamingo Society met on the King Abdullah
          University of Science and Technology campus in Thuwal, Saudi Arabia.
          The society was formed five years ago to coordinate the work of
          private, philanthropically-funded research vessels. Eric King, senior
          director of operations, and Allison Miller, research portfolio senior
          manager, attended the meeting in person, during which society members
          toured the university campus, its marine facilities, and R/V{" "}
          <em>Thuwal</em>. The two-day hybrid gathering allowed members to
          openly discuss new challenges around safety and environmental
          standards, marine scientific research authorizations, and building new
          research vessels. Attendees &mdash; including Dr. Jyotika Virmani, who
          attended virtually &mdash; gave updates on their organizational
          activities, reviewed a survey of impacts by Pink Flamingo Society
          members,{" "}
          <a href="https://oceandecade.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the UN Decade of Ocean Science</a>,
          Ocean Census, and seabed mapping, and discussed ideas for
          presentations at upcoming meetings.

        <h3>Scientific Ocean Vehicle Alliance</h3>
        <p>
          The Scientific Ocean Vehicle Alliance is a professional network of
          scientific ocean vehicle community experts. The alliance was formed
          four years ago to advance subsea ocean science initiatives by
          leveraging members&rsquo; collective experiences and knowledge.
          Sharing insights and lessons learned enhances the overall operations
          of marine science vehicles, improves efficiencies, and standardizes
          operational procedures for ocean science endeavors.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2023, SOVA's membership expanded beyond North America to include
          several international organizations, including the French Research
          Institute for Exploitation of the Sea, the Marine Institute of
          Ireland, the National Oceanographic Center, the University of Porto,
          Portuguese Task Group for the Extension of the Continental Shelf,
          Observatorio Oceanico de Madeira, RevOcean, the University of Bremen,
          and the Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology.
        </p>
        <p>
          In May, Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute and Schmidt Ocean
          Institute co-hosted a meeting at MBARI in Moss Landing, California
          &mdash; the first hybrid event since the pandemic and the first event
          open to the international community. Over 20 people attended, and more
          than 30 participated remotely. In November, Woods Hole Oceanographic
          Institution hosted the second hybrid meeting of the year, attracting
          over 50 attendees from more than 15 organizations.

        <h3>Storytelling for Science</h3>
        <p>
          As part of the UN Ocean Decade Strategic Communications Group, Dr.
          Carlie Wiener led a training,{" "}

            Storytelling for Science
          </a>
          , at the University of California Berkeley and Santa Barbara. The
          workshop included a panel with experts in science journalism,
          including Chris Spinder from CBS, James Temple from MIT Technology
          Review, Bigad Shaban from NBC, and Elizabeth Weise from USA Today. The
          training was recorded and will be shared in 2024 to support Ocean
          Decade-endorsed actions.

          , and staff attended the Third Foundations Dialogue in Monaco. Dr.
          Jyotika Virmani presented the critical opportunities and access to the
          Ocean that SOI provides to scientists, students, and artists for free.
          She outlined a future where the capacity to explore, understand, and
          sustainably manage the Ocean will be truly global. She also
          highlighted the actions SOI is taking to support the Ocean Decade. Dr.
          Carlie Wiener discussed the importance of public engagement within the
          Ocean Decade. Jyotika and Eric King shared the opportunities and
          bottlenecks for research vessels with other participants. SOI is a
          signatory of the{" "}

        <h3>Virtual Symposium</h3>
        <p>
          Schmidt Ocean Institute held its second virtual symposium,{" "}

            Setting the Course
          </a>
          , in the spring of 2023, kicking off our inaugural year of science on
          board R/V <em>Falkor (too)</em>. Over the past three years, we have
          evolved considerably, and this event provided the community with an
          opportunity to learn new things and ask questions. Topics included a
          guided first tour of the new ship, the long-term strategy for boldly
          exploring our unknown Ocean, and measures to broaden inclusivity and
          diversity, including resources available for people with dependents at
          home. Participants also learned how to apply for ship time under the
          revised proposal process, Ship-to-Shore Connections, Berths of
          Opportunity, and Artist-at-Sea residencies.

          This retreat explored the science and technology of ocean worlds
          across the solar system. The network's goals are to advance studies to
          characterize Earth and other ocean worlds and to enhance collaboration
          and communication across various disciplines to accelerate ocean
          worlds and astrobiology explorations.
