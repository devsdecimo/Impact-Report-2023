        <h3>All-Atlantic Floating University</h3>
        <p>
          Training at sea is critical for preparing new generations of early
          career ocean professionals and SOI offers multiple at-sea operations
          opportunities targeting academic and maritime sectors. To strengthen
          and develop further training at sea in the Atlantic region, greater
          exchange, collaboration, and sharing best practices between programs
          is essential. The All-Atlantic Floating University Network was
          established in 2021 to advance these objectives; SOI is one of the
          founding members. The network brings together successful at-sea
          programs working in the Atlantic pole-pole region, and SOI will offer
          Berths of Opportunity through this network when operating in Atlantic
          waters.

          SOI and National Geographic Society celebrated bringing the first
          National Geographic Explorers aboard <em>Falkor (too) </em>as part of
          a new and exciting strategic partnership. Dr. Laura Simon-Sanchez was
          the first investigator, and brought her exploration team of four to
          study microplastic distribution and movement in the water column off
          the coast of Panama. The{" "}

        <p>
          Dr. Ana-Belen Yanez Suarez, another National Geographic Explorer,

            Vertical Reefs of the Gal&aacute;pagos expedition
          </a>
          . Yanez Suarez and the team explored seamounts southwest of Isla del
          Coco and examined links between coral communities on seamounts in the
          Gal&aacute;pagos and those in Costa Rica. The researchers observed
          multiple deep-sea coral species laden with eggs on one of the ROV
          dives. This research contributes data to inform the management of the
          Eastern Tropical Pacific Marine Corridor, a network of interconnected
          marine reserves managed by the governments of Ecuador, Costa Rica,
          Panama, and Colombia.

          research projects to create this virtual institute. This will address
          biogeochemical data and modeling problems across systems and scale
          through new approaches in data collection, integration, and
          interpretation, improving our understanding of the cycling and storage

        <h3>Ocean Census</h3>
        <p>
          Only 10% of ocean life has been discovered. This year, a new
          collaborative was formed to address this gap in knowledge.{" "}
          <a href="http://oceancensus.org">Ocean Census</a> was created as an
          open network of science, business, media, and civil society
          organizations with the goal of accelerating discovery and protection
          of ocean life. Founded by The Nippon Foundation and Nekton, SOI joined
          the global collaborative alliance as a founding member. The
          undertaking builds on historic efforts such as the late 19th century
          Challenger Expeditions, which many credit as the origin of modern
          marine science, and the Census of Marine Life, a decade-long
          international project launched in 2000 to record the diversity,
          distribution, and abundance of life in the Ocean.
        </p>
        <p>
          SOI Executive Director Dr. Jyotika Virmani attended the event in April
          at the Royal Institution, London. She spoke of the need for education
          and communicating with the public about Ocean wonders as key pillars
          of success for the census. Since April, SOI has participated in
          planning discussions focused on establishing taxonomic workshops in
          developing areas where research will occur and bringing taxonomists on
          board R/V
          <em>Falkor (too) </em>to support this ambitious effort.

        <h3>Ocean Rising</h3>
        <p>
          Popular culture challenges and drives how people interact with the
          world around them. Interweaving aspects of our everyday life &mdash;
          from clothes we wear to the games we play &mdash; with the undersea
          world is a powerful avenue for nurturing a new generation of ocean
          ambassadors.{" "}
          <a href="https://schmidtocean.org/ocean-rising/">Ocean Rising</a>,{" "}
          established in 2021 by SOI and Nekton, deepens people&rsquo;s
          relationship with the Ocean by galvanizing connections through global
          popular culture. Since the initiative&rsquo;s inception, workshops
          have brought experts from media, film, publishing, gaming, and fashion
          together to identify obstacles and opportunities for exploring our
          Ocean world. Future plans include workshops for arts and sports-themed
          events in 2024.

        <h3>Seabed 2030</h3>
        <p>
          Since 2019, SOI has played a substantial role as a partner in the{" "}

            Nippon Foundation-GEBCO Seabed 2030 Project
          </a>
          . This international collaboration is working to create a detailed,
          high-resolution seafloor map by 2030. Only 6% of the ocean floor was
          mapped to an adequate resolution when the undertaking was launched;
          today, almost 25% of the seafloor has been mapped, with more than 1
          million square kilometers of mapping data contributed by SOI. In 2023,
          the team aboard Research Vessel Falkor (too) mapped 190,025.60 square
          kilometers of seafloor, including 5 new hydrothermal vent fields, 3
          seamounts, and 2 new cold water coral reefs.
        </p>
        <p>
          In August of this year, Executive Director Dr. Jyotika Virmani
          presented at the Nippon Foundation-GEBCO Alumni Conference in Tokyo.
          In her remarks, she highlighted the power of the alumni network to
          catalyze technologies for seafloor mapping, which advances ocean
          discovery for the greater good. In November, SOI sponsored the{" "}

        <h3>The Deep Sea Continuum/Strategic Partnerships: MTS/IEEE</h3>
        <p>
          SOI&rsquo;s partnership with the Marine Technology Society and IEEE
          Oceanic Engineering Society, or IEEE-OES, focuses on the effective
          development and application of marine science and technology for the
          exploration, understanding, and sustainable use of the Ocean and its
          resources.
        </p>
        <p>
          The partnership includes support for students and early career marine
          technology professionals through a student poster competition, joint
          activities to engage women in marine science and technology, and
          special events in the United States. This summer, in partnership with
          IEEE-OES, SOI welcomed{" "}
