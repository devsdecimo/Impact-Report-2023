        <h3>All-Atlantic Floating University</h3>
        <p>
          Training at sea is critical for preparing new generations of early
          career ocean professionals. The All-Atlantic Floating University
          Network was established in 2021 to strengthen and develop
          opportunities in the Atlantic region and to foster greater exchange,
          collaboration, and sharing of best practices between programs. The
          network brings together successful at-sea programs working in the
          Atlantic pole-to-pole region to find ways to increase student
          sea-going research and training opportunities. Schmidt Ocean Institute
          became a member in 2023 and will offer Berths of Opportunities through
          this network when operating in Atlantic waters from 2025-2028.

        <p>
          Schmidt Ocean Institute&rsquo;s partnership with the Marine Technology
          Society and IEEE-Oceanic Engineering Society, or IEEE-OES, focuses on
          broadening inclusivity, participation, and hence diversity, in the
          marine technical and engineering disciplines.
        </p>
        <p>
          The partnership includes support for students and early-career marine
          technology professionals through student poster competitions, joint
          activities to engage women in marine science and technology, and
          special events in the United States. In partnership with IEEE-OES this

            Ocean Biogeochemistry Virtual Institute, or OBVI
          </a>
          , to tackle challenging data and modeling problems in ocean
          biogeochemistry research. Together, the organizations are offering to
          support successful applicants with up to five years of financial
          resources, research time aboard R/V<em> Falkor (too)</em>, and access
          to the Schmidt Ocean Institute&rsquo;s high-performance computing
          system.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2023, the competition received 117 expressions of intent from 48
          countries; we invited 14 of the research teams to submit full
          proposals representing scientists from the United States, Canada,
          South Africa, the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Israel, Ghana,
          Namibia, Brazil, Belgium, Ireland, Italy, Spain, and Madagascar. OBVI
          expects to award five interdisciplinary, international, and innovative
          research projects to create this virtual institute. The awardees will
          address biogeochemical data and modeling problems across systems and
          scale through new data collection, integration, and interpretation
          approaches, improving our understanding of the cycling and storage of
          carbon in the Ocean and the resilience of marine ecosystems.

          Only 10% of ocean life has been discovered, and a new collaboration
          was formed to address this knowledge gap. The{" "}

          Founded by The Nippon Foundation and Nekton, Schmidt Ocean Institute
          joined the initiative as a founding member. The undertaking builds on
          historic efforts such as the late 19th century Challenger Expeditions,
          which many credit as the origin of modern marine science, and the
          Census of Marine Life, a decade-long international project launched in
          2000 to record the diversity, distribution, and abundance of life in
          the Ocean.

        <h3>Ocean Rising</h3>
        <p>
          Popular culture challenges and drives how people interact with the
          world around them. Interweaving aspects of our everyday life &mdash;
          from the clothes we wear to the games we play &mdash; with the
          undersea world is a powerful avenue for raising awareness of the
          Ocean. Established in 2021 by Schmidt Ocean Institute and Nekton,{" "}
          <a href="https://schmidtocean.org/ocean-rising/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ocean Rising</a>{" "}
          deepens people&rsquo;s relationship with the Ocean by galvanizing
          connections through global popular culture. Since the
          initiative&rsquo;s inception, workshops have brought media, film, fine
          art, theater, and fashion experts together to identify obstacles and
          opportunities for exploring our Ocean world.

            Nippon Foundation-GEBCO Seabed 2030 Project

          , a collaboration of organizations that map the seafloor or have an
          interest in hydrography. This international collaboration is working
          to create a detailed, high-resolution seafloor map by 2030. Only 6% of
          the ocean floor was mapped to an adequate resolution when the
          undertaking launched in 2016; today, almost 25% of the seafloor has
          been mapped, with 1.5 million square kilometers of mapping data
          contributed by Schmidt Ocean Institute. In 2023, the team aboard the
          research vessel <em>Falkor (too)</em> mapped 190,025 square kilometers
          of the seafloor, including five new hydrothermal vent fields, seven
          seamounts, and two new cold-water coral reefs.
