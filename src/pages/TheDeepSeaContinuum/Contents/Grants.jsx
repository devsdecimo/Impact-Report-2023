          program. The underwater robotics competition for students from
          elementary to university is designed to engage students with STEM
          careers, build confidence, and develop professional skills.
        </p>

        <p>
          Schmidt Ocean Institute provided funding to rebuild the program
          post-pandemic and expand the competition&rsquo;s global reach. Their
          2023 competition challenge focused on the United Nations Decade of
          Ocean Science for Sustainable Development. Participants were
          instructed to design and build a remotely operated vehicle, or ROV,
          including the necessary sensors and tooling to support tasks that
          could aid in combating climate change, providing clean energy, feeding
          our growing global population, monitoring ocean health, and preserving
          maritime history. The 21st competition, which took place in late June
          in Longmont, CO, USA, included 59 teams representing more than 1,000
          students from 11 countries and 18 U.S. states.
        </p>
        <p>
          Six hundred fifty-five students from 2023 completed a post-competition
          survey; 86% showed an increased awareness and interest in pursuing
          STEM careers after building their ROV. The instructors also observed a
          91% increase in their students&rsquo; interest in pursuing a STEM
          career.

          ocean time-series stations near Bermuda and Hawaii. Bottles of
          seawater from those stations are delivered to the Scripps Institution

              Florida Institute of Oceanography hosted a welcome and homeporting
              celebration for the vessel, which the Monterey Bay Aquarium
              Research Institute donated; university officials and dignitaries
              from around the country, including Schmidt Ocean Institute
              Executive Director Dr. Jyotika Virmani, attended the event. Early
              career experiences at sea inspire and encourage the next
              generation of scientists, maritime professionals, and educators,
              and this program is working to build a robust ocean science
              workforce.
