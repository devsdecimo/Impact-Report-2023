        expedition, researchers at University of Rhode Island, or URI, and
        Lehigh University were provided grants to implement a variety of
        analytical techniques to samples collected at the Western Galapagos
        Spreading Center. URI will employ a unique population genomics approach
        to analyze host animals and bacterial symbionts, allowing scientists to
        better understand population connectivity, diversity, and adaptation of
        these organisms. Lehigh will use a combination of chemical techniques to
        investigate the hydrothermal vent fluid dynamics at the spreading
        center.

      <h3>MATE ROV</h3>
      <p>
        SOI was pleased to continue support to the MATE ROV program in 2023. The
        Schmidt Ocean Coalition provided a one-year grant of $75,000 for
        first-time MATE team scholarships to lessen the financial barriers to
        participation in the competition. This funding helped students from
        underserved and underrepresented communities to participate, leading to
        broader diversity and inclusion in the MATE ROV competition and,
        inevitably, to the ocean STEM pipeline.
      </p>
      <p>
        MATE ROV is an underwater robotics competition for students from
        elementary level to university. The competition is designed to engage
        students with STEM careers, build confidence, and develop professional
        skills. This grant provided funds to rebuild the program post-pandemic
        and expand its global reach. Their 2023 season highlighted the United
        Nations Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development, challenging
        participants to design and build an ROV including the necessary sensors
        and tooling to support tasks that could aid in combating climate change,
        provide clean energy, feed our growing global population, monitor ocean
        health, and preserve maritime history.
      </p>
      <p>
        655 student participants completed a post competition survey; 86% showed
        an increased awareness and interest in pursuing STEM careers after
        building their ROV. The instructors also observed a 91% increase in
        their students&rsquo; interest in pursuing a STEM career.

      <h3>National Ocean Sciences Bowl</h3>
      <p>
        The National Ocean Sciences Bowl, or NOSB, took a year hiatus from
        competition in 2023 to establish its new office within the University
        Corporation for Atmospheric Research&rsquo;s Center for Ocean
        Leadership. A SOI grant was instrumental in ushering the program through
        this time of change, allowing NOSB to retain its staff and begin to plan
        for the future of the program. With SOI&rsquo;s support, regional
        competitions will return nationwide in 2024 to allow students to
        strengthen their experiences with and understanding of marine
        environments, and showcase their knowledge of the Ocean.
      </p>
      <h3>Ocean Coalition</h3>
      <p>
        Since 2020, a coalition of Schmidt entities, including SOI, 11th Hour
        Racing, the Schmidt Family Foundation, and Schmidt Marine Technology
        Partners, have been collaborating to provide joint support for
        organizations that work to improve inclusion in marine science through
        education and early career opportunities and training.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2023, the coalition added seven new grants to its existing portfolio
        of eleven, bringing its total program to approximately $1.2 million.
        Grants are primarily awarded to projects led by BIPOC individuals and
        serve BIPOC and/or other historically underrepresented communities
        worldwide. These grants supported programs focused on education,
        networking, career training, and professional development opportunities
        that expand access to Ocean sciences and related fields. The 2023
        grantees included Ocean Discovery League, Washington Maritime Blue,
        Black Women in Ecology, Evolution, and Marine Science, MoonJelly, and
        more.

      <h3>Ocean Keeling Curve</h3>
      <p>
        SOI continued support for one of the longest-running daily records of
        global atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration, the{" "}
        <a href="https://keelingcurve.ucsd.edu/">
          Ocean Keeling Curve project.
        </a>{" "}
        These measurements are critical for assessing changes in the
        Ocean&rsquo;s global carbon cycle and are taken at three ocean
        time-series stations near Bermuda and Hawaii. Bottles of seawater from
        those stations are delivered to the Scripps Institution of Oceanography
        for study. Aside from a brief pause during the pandemic, sampling and
        analysis have been ongoing. A key step in the analytical process went
        through extensive refurbishment with software and system upgrades this
        year; the Electronic Constant Volume Manometer is used to measure the
        amount of extracted CO<sub>2</sub> gas and it is now ready to support
        future analyses.
      </p>
      <h3>&nbsp;Peerside</h3>
      <p>
        SOI supports the{" "}
        <a href="https://www.fio.usf.edu/peerside/">
          Florida Institute of Oceanography&rsquo;s (FIO) Peerside program
        </a>{" "}
        for career networking and mentorship in ocean STEAM disciplines.
        Peerside celebrated its inaugural year with at-sea programming. 16
        students worked aboard Research Vessel <em>Western Flyer</em>, supported
        by five mentors who guided their experience and research. The students
        participated in sediment coring and geophysical mapping with a towed
        side scan sonar and a sub-bottom profiler. The hands-on experience
        provided a greater understanding of the history of paleo-hurricane
        impacts in the Florida region.
      </p>
      <p>
        FIO hosted a welcome and homeporting celebration for the vessel,
        attended by university officials and dignitaries from around the
        country, including SOI Executive Director Dr. Jyotika Virmani. SOI
        believes early career experiences at sea are important for inspiring and
        encouraging the next generation of scientists, maritime professionals,
        and educators and celebrates this partnership for working to build a
        robust ocean science workforce.

        take time off from work to participate in career-building at sea without
        worrying about critical loss of income. The students collected seawater
        samples to analyze nutrients and carbon chemistry to complement the
        expedition research with additional seawater data. They also
        participated in outreach by drafting blog posts and engaging in social
        media activities.
      </p>
      <h3>Local Technology Support</h3>
      <p>
        This year, SOI granted $5,000 to two organizations in the region where
        <em>Falkor (too) </em>teams were working in order to support learning
        about the Ocean. The Jos&eacute; Fabio Garnier Ugalde School in Costa
        Rica used the funds to purchase an interactive screen and IT equipment,
        enriching the students&rsquo; learning experience by watching expedition
        videos and following the SOI dive streams. Additionally, the Charles
        Darwin Foundation in Ecuador used the funds to purchase IT equipment,
        including a new laptop, speakers, and a screen, to increase outreach to
        community groups and create new opportunities to connect with
        scientists.
