        <h3>Conference Sponsorship</h3>
        <p>
          Conferences, workshops, and symposia provide a platform for the
          oceanographic research and technology communities to network, educate,
          and collaborate. SOI remains committed to sponsoring events, and
          strives to make them more effective and accessible. This year, SOI
          sponsored:

        <h3>NSF Decadal Survey of Ocean Science</h3>
        <p>
          Allison Miller, research portfolio senior manager for SOI, is serving
          on a National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine
          committee charged with developing and publishing the{" "}
          <a href="https://www.nationalacademies.org/our-work/2025-2035-decadal-survey-of-ocean-sciences-for-the-national-science-foundation" target="_blank">
            Decadal Survey of Ocean Sciences for the National Science Foundation
          </a>
          , or NSF. Three public listening sessions were held across the ocean
          community on ocean-observing infrastructure, machine learning and
          artificial intelligence, ocean acidification and climate change, and
          the current state of scientific ocean drilling.
        </p>
        <p>
          In early 2025, the committee will present its final report to NSF,
          with its recommended forward-looking approaches to investments in
          research, infrastructure, and workforce development. The committee has
          been tasked with developing and reporting on a compelling research and
          infrastructure strategy to advance understanding of the Ocean&rsquo;s
          role in Earth systems and the sustainable blue economy. The committee
          will alsorecommend ways NSF could develop capacity to respond nimbly
          as priorities change and new opportunities emerge over the 2025-2035
          decade.

        <h3>Pink Flamingo Society</h3>
        <p>
          &nbsp;In November, the Pink Flamingo Society met on the King Abdullah
          University of Science and Technology, or KAUST, campus in Thuwal,
          Saudi Arabia. The society was formed five years ago to coordinate the
          work of private, philanthropically-funded research vessels. Research
          Portfolio Senior Manager for SOI, Allison Miller, and Eric King,
          senior director of operations, attended the meeting where the society
          toured the KAUST campus, its marine facilities, and R/V{" "}
          <em>Thuwal</em>. The two-day meeting allowed members to openly discuss
          new challenges around safety standards, environmental standards,
          marine scientific research authorizations, and building new research
          vessels. Ideas were shared for presentations at upcoming meetings, the{" "}
          <a href="https://en.unesco.org/underwater-heritage/UN-decade" target="_blank">
            UN Decade of Ocean Science,

          and other potential new initiatives.

        <h3>Scientific Ocean Vehicle Alliance</h3>
        <p>
          The Scientific Ocean Vehicle Alliance, or SOVA, is a professional
          network of experts in the scientific ocean vehicle community.
          Established in 2020 by Jason Williams, lead mechanical engineer for
          SOI, its primary goal is to advance subsea ocean science initiatives
          by leveraging members&rsquo; collective experiences and knowledge.
          Sharing insights and lessons learned enhances the overall operations
          of marine science vehicles, improves efficiencies, and standardizes
          operational procedures for ocean science endeavors.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2023, SOVA's membership expanded beyond North America to include
          several international organizations, including Ifremer, the Marine
          Institute of Ireland, OceanX, the National Oceanographic Center,
          Portuguese Task Group, RevOcean, the University of Bremen, and the
          Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology.
        </p>
        <p>
          In May, Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute and SOI co-hosted a
          meeting in Moss Landing, California &mdash; the first hybrid event
          since the pandemic and the first event open to the international
          community. Over 20 people attended and more than 30 participated
          remotely. In November, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution hosted the
          second hybrid meeting of the year, attracting over 50 attendees from
          more than 15 organizations. Anyone interested in joining this group
          should contact Jason Williams at SOI or any SOVA member.

        <h3>UN Decade of Ocean Science</h3>
        <p>
          SOI continued its partnership with UNESCO on the UN Decade of Ocean
          Science for Sustainable Development. Three of SOI&rsquo;s staff have
          been actively providing guidance on subcommittees. Corinne Bassin,
          data solutions architect, was appointed to the United Nations Ocean
          Decade Data Strategy Implementation Group; Jyotika Virmani, executive
          director, continued to chair the Technology and Innovation Informal
          Working Group; and Carlie Wiener, director of communications,
          continued to co-chair the Strategic Communications Group.
        </p>
        <p>
          As part of the Strategic Communications Group, Wiener led a training,
          Storytelling for Science, at University of California Berkeley and
          Santa Barbara. The workshop included a panel with experts in science
          journalism, including Chris Spinder from CBS, James Temple from MIT
          Technology Review, Bigad Shaban from NBC, and Elizabeth Weise from USA
          Today. The training was recorded and will be shared to support Ocean
          Decade-endorsed actions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Additionally, SOI participated in the UN Ocean Decade Third
          Foundations Dialogue in Monaco, where Virmani presented on sea-going
          opportunities for the Decade. The meeting resulted in a joint
          statement amplifying the role of the philanthropic community in global
          ocean action as part of the Ocean Decade. SOI was one of the
          co-signers and will continue our commitment to Decade actions.

        <h3>Virtual Symposium</h3>
        <p>
          SOI held its second virtual symposium, <em>Setting the Course,</em> in
          the spring of 2023, kicking off our inaugural year of science on board
          R/V{" "}<em>Falkor</em>
          <em>(too)</em>. The event provided the community with a guided first
          tour of the ship and shared SOI&rsquo;s long-term strategy for boldly
          exploring our unknown Ocean. SOI Executive Director Dr. Jyotika
          Virmani delivered opening remarks and discussed data sharing and
          strategic partnerships. SOI staff presented on applying for ship time,
          the Ship-to-Shore program, applying for Berths of Opportunity, and
          Artist-at-Sea residencies. Discussions covered targeted grants,
          resources available for people with dependents at home, and broadening
          inclusivity and diversity in the marine sciences. At the end of the
          two-day symposium, audiences were able to explore the full range of
          SOI&rsquo;s efforts to bring the wonders of the Ocean to life.
