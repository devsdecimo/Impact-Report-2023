        expedition, researchers at University of Rhode Island, or URI, and
        Lehigh University were provided grants to implement a variety of
        analytical techniques to samples collected at the Western Galapagos
        Spreading Center. URI will employ a unique population genomics approach
        to analyze host animals and bacterial symbionts, allowing scientists to
        better understand population connectivity, diversity, and adaptation of
        these organisms. Lehigh will use a combination of chemical techniques to
        investigate the hydrothermal vent fluid dynamics at the spreading
        center.

        Combined, this analysis will yield a comprehensive look at how hotspot
        volcanism impacts fluid chemistry and the associated communities in this
        unique region. These data analytics grants were the first of their kind
        for SOI, and we hope to offer support for data analysis in the future.
